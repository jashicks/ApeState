    <string name="about_information">My name is Jalynn Hicks, I am the developer and the founder of ApeState. My mission is to bring educational information on all sorts of great apes since theyâ€™re mostly related to us more than other organism and species in the world. You would be very surprised how many similarities we share with our closest cousins.
